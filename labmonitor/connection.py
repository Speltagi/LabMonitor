    A class to manage SSH connections to remote machines.

    This class allows establishing an SSH connection to a remote machine using
    the provided connection details (IP address, username, and password). It can
    also be used to execute commands remotely and interact with the machine.

    Attributes:
    ip (str): The IP address of the remote machine.
    username (str): The username for authentication on the remote machine.
    password (str): The password associated with the username for authentication.
    ssh (paramiko.SSHClient): The SSH client instance used to manage the connection.

    Methods:
    __init__(self, ip: str, username: str, password: str): Initializes the Connection object with the provided connection details and establishes an SSH connection.

    set_connection(self): Sets the connection details for a machine.

    get_connection(self): Establishes an SSH connection to a remote machine using the provided connection details.
    
    execute_ssh_command(self, command:str): Executes a command over an established SSH connection.
