  abstract="A new cluster resource management system called Simple Linux Utility Resource Management (SLURM) is described in this paper. SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.",

  abstract="The Resource and Job Management System (RJMS) is the middleware in charge of delivering computing power to applications in HPC systems. The increasing number of computational resources in modern supercomputers brings new levels of parallelism and complexity. To maximize the global throughput while ensuring good efficiency of applications, RJMS must deal with issues like manageability, scalability and network topology awareness. This paper is focused on the evaluation of the so-called RJMS SLURM regarding these issues. It presents studies performed in order to evaluate, adapt and prepare the configuration of the RJMS to efficiently manage two Bull petaflop supercomputers installed at CEA, Tera-100 and Curie. The studies evaluate the capability of SLURM to manage large numbers of compute resources and jobs as well as to provide an optimal placement of jobs on clusters using a tree interconnect topology. Experiments presented in this paper are conducted using both real-scale and emulated supercomputers using synthetic workloads. The synthetic workloads are derived from the ESP benchmark and adapted to the evaluation of the RJMS internals. Emulations of larger supercomputers are performed to assess the scalability and the direct eligibility of SLURM to manage larger systems.",
